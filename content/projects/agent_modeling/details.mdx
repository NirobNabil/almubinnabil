# Pytorch network as a differential solver to find optimal investment strategy for Bangladesh power development board

> Worked on a government project to design a pipeline that uses a pytorch network as a differential solver that tweaks investment amount in different electricity sources like wind, coal, gas and solar to find the optimal investment strategy that minimizes load shedding in Bangladesh over a 30 year horizon taking into account effect of vulnerability to natural disasters and carbon pollution.

We designed a pytorch based neural network that acts as a differential solver to optimize the investment strategy for Bangladesh power development board. The model takes into account various factors such as load demand growth, generation capacity, Installation and maintenance costs, fuel costs, carbon emissions, and vulnerability to natural disasters over a 30-year horizon. By simulating different investment scenarios and adjusting the allocation of funds across various energy sources (wind, coal, gas, solar), the model identifies the optimal strategy that minimizes load shedding while considering environmental and economic constraints.
