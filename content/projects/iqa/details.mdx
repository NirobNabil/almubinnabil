# Adversarial Robustness Evaluation for NR-IQA Models under MOS-Stratified Perturbations

> Conducted a comprehensive robustness evaluation of no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) models under MOS-stratified perturbations. Developed metrics and testing strategies to measure performance across varying image distortions and subjective quality strata. Demonstrated insights on model stability and reliability for real-world applications in computer vision and multimedia analytics.

> Designed robust benchmarking framework for NR-IQA models.

> Ongoing project

IQA based MOS-stratified perturbation analysis for robustness is an open field. Very few works have explored this area. Our work implements a patch-based noise pattern generation that maximizes our custom IQA image quality metric degradation (and upgradation) under different subjective quality strata. The patch-based approach allows for localized perturbations that better simulate real-world distortions, while also mimicing noise generation algorithms such as Perlin noise.
