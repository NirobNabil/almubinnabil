we introduced a new dataset consisting of 1,864 samples, with 1,464 images collected
from Sylhet city, Bangladesh, and 384 images scraped from YouTube videos of parking lots
focusing on the diversity in lighting conditions, locations, and camera perspectives to address the
limitations of existing datasets. Our work also introduces a novel approach for detecting parking
spot occupancy by training model to detect cars instead of training to detect parking spots which
greatly increases overall performance. Our results show that YOLOv8, trained on our dataset,
significantly outperforms models trained on traditional datasets. Combining our dataset with
KITTI achieved a 90% accuracy in parking occupancy detection, outperforming existing datasets
and highlighting the scalability of our approach.
